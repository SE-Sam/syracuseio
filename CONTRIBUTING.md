# Contribution Guide

## Looking for features / issues

If you are interested in adding something to the site or found something that should be looked into, head over to the Issues tab on this repository. There you will find a list of issues that are currently to be looked into. If you want to post something that currently is not in said list, go ahead and create a new issue.

## Wanting some help, why not pair?

If you would like to tackle something but would like some guidance, we'd be up to have a [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) session with you. If you would be interested in having a paring session, contact us here (TODO: List way to get in contact with developers)

If you're working in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, [VS Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) for a pairing environment can work well for a collabaration service.

## Pull Requests Process

The process for Pull Requests can start as early as you wish and can be helpful to guide the focus on the path for the fix or enhancement. Opening the PR before it is ready to be merged can allow the conversation between contributors and maintainers to start early.

If you wish to push a PR up but do not want it reviewed yet, add "WIP" to the beginning of the PR. This can notify the team that it isn't ready for review yet. Once the PR is ready for review, the maintainers will examine your changes and help get the PR to the finish line and merged in.
